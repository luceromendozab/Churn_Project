This is a Churn analysis project for a telecommunications company in California. The company provides phone and internet services to its customers, and this project analyzes customer churn data as well as other factors that may influence it.

# Introducci√≥n 
# Objetivos 
# Data Sources

The telecommunications company data includes information on 7,043 customers in California during the third quarter of the year. The data contains customer demographic information, satisfaction scores, churn scores, and customer lifetime value (CLTV) values.


# Project structure
Data: This folder contains the data used in the project, including the raw data and the data uses in SQL,Machine Learing and Visualization. 

Notebooks: This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and the Machine Learning algorithms. 

SQL: Contains the relational model of our data and the insertion of data through SQLalchemy from Python.

# Conclusions and Solutions

After analyzing the telecommunications company's churn data, the following findings were found:

Based on these findings, the following solutions are recommended

# Tools Used
- Programming Language: Python

- Python Libraries:

    - Pandas: Used for manipulation and data analysis in the DataFrame containing diamond characteristics and prices.

    - NumPy: Used for matrix manipulation and numerical calculations in data preprocessing.

    - Matplotlib: Used for data visualization and distribution charts of variables.

    - Seaborn: Used for visualization of variable distributions and correlations between them.

    - Scikit-learn: Used for implementation of machine learning models, feature selection, and evaluation of model performance.

    - imblearn: Machine learning library that provides tools for handling and treating class imbalance problems in data sets. Over and under-sampling combination was used.

    - Pickle: Used for saving the final trained model and its subsequent use for making predictions on new data.

    -  Sqlalchemy: Provides a set of tools for working with databases through an object-oriented programming interface (API), which means that Python objects can be created to represent database tables, columns, and relationships between them.
